  Name : Ahmed Alshakh
  Final Project 
      Room with different objects some of them moves.
  Time : almost all the waking time in 4 days
***************************

#Build and Run:
    make clean
    make
    ./project
#Usage :
    // Room mode
    0          : reset everything
    Arrows     : change angle of view
    pg up/down : move relative to view angle (forward/backward)
    x,y,z      : move absolutely on the axis (increment) (mostly not needed)
    X,Y,Z      : move absolutely on the axis (decrement) (mostly not needed)
    
    l          : toggle moving light or light from the lamp
    ], [       : moving light up/down
    }, {       : moving light larger/smaller circle
    
    t          : Things will move/stop in the room
        When things are moving
              1 : moves only the rubik's cube on the desk.
              2 : moves only the rubik's cube on the book shelf
              3 : moves only the solar system model
              4 : moves only the open book on the desk.
              5 : moves only the open book on the reading table.
              6 : moves only the ISS model in the corner.
              7 : moves only the clock on the bookshelf
              8 : moves everything again

   // Object Mode : see some interesting objects closely
   o,O      : go in/out of object mode
   m        : go to next object
   a/d      : some objects will move if you press a/d
   Arrow    : change view angle
   page up/down : zoom in/out
   

#Interesting things:
* I spend many many hours figuring out how to draw revolution solids with correct normals.
    The trumpet and vases are examples for this. I even was able to draw two surfaces,
    inside surface and outside surface to get the normals correct from inside and outside.
* The thing that took me the most time was the book which can open and close.

#Things I thought about but I didn't have the time for:
* Change the angle of view automatically to look at the object that is moving in this moment.
    I figured out how to do it but didn't have time
* Floating numbers above things that can move to indicate the button to press
* Openable drawers in the desk.
* Loading different books, but I only had the time for four covers and two pages.
* And some other objects


Files:
main.c        : main function and glut functions
furniture.c   : responsible for chairs and tables and the book shelf
room.c        : uses most other files to draw the actual room
geometry.h/.c : generic code for different basic objects
solidOfRevolution.c : draws solid of revolution
iss, rubikCube, solarSystemModel, book and clock : draw different objects.
